# Food Security Monitoring - Frontend PoC

This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a map-based interface showcasing data insights related to food security, developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Design Overview

For the UX/UI design, I used [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) to set up the layout with AI-generated wireframes. Alternatively, tools like Figma could be used for manual wireframe creation.

## Getting Started

This project uses **pnpm** instead of npm for package management, which provides faster and more efficient builds.

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To build the project for production, use:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js for server-side rendering and scalability.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on AWS S3 for its serverless architecture benefits (scalability and cost efficiency).
